# Some exercise models

* 'classification\_penguins' contains a MLP model with dropout regularization to classify 3 groups of penguins based on culmen length and width, as well as flipper length from a seaborn dataset
* 'classification\_rock\_paper\_scissors' contains a pretrained Deep Convolutional model (MobileNet V2) which is retrained on a rock-paper-scissors dataset
* 'regression\_diamond\_prices' contains a MLP model to predict prices of diamonds based on their size, carat, and clarity from a seaborn dataset
* 'vae\_faces' contains a variational-autoencoder model trained on a processed form of the 'labelled faces in the wild' dataset
* 'vae\_mnist' contains a variational-autoencoder model trained on the mnist dataset
